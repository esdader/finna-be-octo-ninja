                <p>some very Austin cats shared a collective daydream. Which turned into a vision. Which, after a few rounds and a healthy dose of BS, sprung forth into a full blown hullabaloo. Like a bizarre double hopped phoenix springing forth from the wort--South Austin Brewery was born. We set forth with a very clear mission…which we quickly forgot. So we amble onward, following our love of good brew, good tunes, and good vibes, wherever it may lead. The only truth we hold to be self evident is that music, beer, and Austin are inextricably bound, molded in the eternal furnace of the beer-smith of the gods. The rest is, like, up for debate man. That’s probably not good enough for Wall Street investors. But it’s good enough for us and we hope it’s good if enough for you. If it’s not, you can kiss our ass.</p>
